### Finite and Non-Finite Verbs

#### Finite Verbs

​	 **Finite Verbs** are those **verbs** that **have a definite relation** with the **subject** or **noun**.These **verbs** are usually a **main verb** of a **clause** or **sentence** and can be changed **according to the noun**.They are used only in **present** and **past tense**.They can be **indicative** of **passive** or **active** voice and also of **number** (singular or plural).



She **walks** home. --- Here we see that the finite verb is **walks** and the pronoun is 'she'.

She **walked** home.  --- Here we can see how the verb changed/modified to change the tense of the sentence.

#### Non-Finite Verbs

​	These verbs **cannot be the main verb** of a clause or sentence as they do not talk about the **action** that is being **performed** by the **subject** or **noun**. They do not indicate any **tense**, **mood** or **gender**. They are used as **nouns**, **adverbs** and **adjectives**.They are also used to form **non-finite clauses** which are simply **dependent clauses** that **use non-finite verbs**.

​	He loves **camping** in the woods. --- Here the non-finite verb is **camping** and it is used as a **noun**. These kind of **non-finite verbs** are called **Gerunds**.

​	I need to go **to sleep**.  ---  Here the non-finite verb is **to sleep**, it is acting as a **noun**. **Non-finite verbs** that use 'to' before them are called **infinitives**.

​	The **sleeping** dog caused a delay.	--- The **nonfinite verbs** that have '-**ing**' or '-**ed**' as **suffixes** and cause the verb to become an **adjective** are called **Participles**.
