### 2.The formation of adverbs with ly

- ​	**kindly** can be adjective or adverb, but other <u>adjectives ending in **ly**</u>,e.g. **friendly**, **likely**, **lonely** etc**. cannot be used as adverbs** and **have no adverb form**.To supply this deficiency we use a similar adverb or adverb phrase:

​	likely(adjective)						friendly(adjective)

​	probably(adverb)					in a friendly way(adverb phrase)

- Some adverbs have a narrower meaning than their corresponding adjectives or differ from them.

  coldly, coolly, hotly, warmly are used mainly of feelings:

  ​	We received them coldly.(in an unfriendly way)

  ​	They denied the accusation hotly.(indignantly)

  ​	She welcomed us warmly.( in a friendly way)

  But **warmly dressed** = **wearing warm clothes**.

  coolly = calmly/courageously or calmly/impudently.

  ​	He behaved very coolly in this dangerous situation.

  presently = soon: He'll be here presently.
