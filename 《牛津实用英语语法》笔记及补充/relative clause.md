#### 1.definition of *relative clause*:  

In grammar,a **relative clause** is a **subordinate clause** which **specifies or gives information** about a **person** or **thing**.Relative clauses come after a noun or pronoun and,in English,often begin with a **relative pronoun** such as '**who**','**which**',or '**that**'.

#### 2.definition of *subordinate clause*:  

a **clause** in a **complex sentence** that **cannot stand alone** as a complete sentence and that **functions** within the sentence **as a noun** or **adjective** or **adverb**.

#### *3.Defining* *relative clauses*

​		We use *defining relative clauses* to give **essential** information about **someone** or **something** ——information that we need in order to **understand** what or who is being referred to.A *defining relative clause* usually **comes immediately after the noun** it describes.

​		We usually use a relative pronoun(e.g. who,that,which,whose and whom) to introduce a defining relative clause(In the examples,the **relative clause** is in **bold**,and the person or thing being referred to is <u>underlined</u>.):

​		They're <u>the people</u> **who want to buy our house**.

​		Here are <u>some cells</u> **which have been affected**.

​		They should give the money <u>to somebody</u> **who they think needs the treatment most**.

[talking about an actress]

​	She'w now playing <u>a woman</u> **whose son was killed in the First World War**.

Spoken English:

In **defining relative clauses** we often use *that* instead of *who*,*whom* or *which*.This is very common in informal speaking:

​	They're <u>the people</u> **that** want to buy our house.

​	Here are <u>some cells</u> **that** have been affected.

Subject or object

The **relative pronoun** can define the **subject** or the **object** of the **verb**:

​	They're <u>the people</u> **who/that bought our house**.（The people bought our house.*The people* is the subject.)

​	They're <u>the people</u> **who/that she met at Jon's party**.(She met the people.*The people* is the object.)

​	Here are <u>some cells</u> **which/that show abnormality**.(Some cells show abnormality.Some cells is subject.)

​	Here are <u>some cells</u> **which/that the researcher has identified**.(The researcher has identified some cells.*Some cells* is the object.)

No relative pronoun

We often **leave out the relative pronoun** when it is the **object** of the **verb**.

​	They're <u>the people</u> **she met at Jon's party**.

​	Here are <u>some cells</u> **the researcher has identified**.

4.Defining relative clauses usually *follow* **the+noun**,but they can also be used with **a/an+noun**,plural nouns without **the** and the pronouns **all**,**none**,**anybody**,**somebody** etc. and **those**.

Clauses following **a/an + noun**,plural nouns without **the** and **somebody**/**someone**/**something** sometimes define their noun/pronoun only indirectly.The noun/pronoun in these cases is usually the **object** of a verb or preposition:

​	I met someone **who** said he knew you.

​	The book is about a girl **who** falls in love with...

Sometimes these clauses are **separated** from their noun/pronoun **by a word or phrase**:

​	There's a man here **who** wants...

​	I saw something in the paper **which** would interest you.

But normally **relative clauses** should be placed **directly after** their noun or pronoun:

​	The noise **that** he made woke everybody up.

​	She was annoyed by something **that** I had said.

#### 5.Defining relative clauses:persons

##### 	A.Subject: <u>who</u> or <u>that</u>

​		**who** is normally used;but **that** is a possible alternative after **all**,**everyone**,**everybody**,**noone**,**nobody** and **those**.

#####     B.Object of a verb: whom or who or that

​		The object form is **whom**,but this is considered very formal.In spoken English we normally use **who** or **that**(**that** being more usual than **who**),and it is still more common to omit the object pronoun altogether.

##### 	C. With a preposition:whom or that

​		In formal English the **preposition** is placed before the **relative pronoun**,which must then be put into the form **whom**:

​		the man **to whom** I spoke

​		In informal speech,however,it is more usual to move the **proposition** to the end of the clause. **whom** then is often replaced by **that**,but it is still more common to omit the relative altogether.

##### 	D.Possessive

​		**whose** is the only possible form.

#### 6.Defining relative clauses:things

##### 	A. Subject

​		 Either **which** or **that**,**which** is the more formal.

##### 	B Object of a verb

​		**which** or **that**,or no relative at all:

​		**which** is <u>hardly ever</u> used after **all**,**everything**,**little**,**much**,**none**,**no** and compounds of **no**,or after superlatives.Instead we use **that**,or **omit the relative altogether**,if it is the object of a verb.

##### 	C. Object of a preposition

​		The formal construction is **preposition + which**,but it is more usual to move the **preposition** to the **end of the clause**,using which or that or **omitting the relative altogether**.

##### 	D.Possessive

​		**whose+a** **clause** is possible but **with + a** **phrase** is more usual:

​			a house **whose** walls were made of glass        a house **with** glass walls

##### 	E. Relative adverbs: when,where,why

​		Note that **when** can replace **in**/**on** **which**(used of time);

​		**where** can replace **in**/**at** **which**(used of place)

​				the hotel **where**(**=in**/**at** **which**) they were staying

​		**why** can  replace  **for which**:The reason **why** he refused is...

​		**when**,**where** and **why** used in this way are called **relative adverbs**.

#### 7 Cleft sentences: it + be + noun/pronoun+defining relative clause

​		It was Tom <u>who helped us</u>.(not Bill or Jack)

​		It was Ann <u>that I saw</u>.(not Mary)

​	When the **object** is a **proper noun**,as above,**that** is more usual than **who**.With all other objects,**that** is the correct form:

​		It's the manager **that** we want to see.

​		It was wine **that** we ordered.(not beer)

​		**that** is usual for **non-personal subjects**:

​				It's speed **that** causes accidents,not bad roads.

#### 8. A relative clause replaced by an infinitive or a participle

##### 	A  Infinitives can be used:

​		1.After **the first/second** etc. and after **the last/only** and sometimes after superlatives:

​				the last man **to leave** the ship =

​			    the last man **who left/leaves** the ship

​				the only one **to udnerstand** = 

​				the only one **who understood/understands**

​		Notice that the **infinitive** here replaces a **subject pronoun+verb**. It could **not** be used to replace an **object pronoun+verb**.For example the clause in **the first man that we saw** could not be replaced by an infinitive,for **the first man to see** would have a completely different meaning.If,however,that is the subject of a passive verb,e.g. **the first man that was seen**,we can replace the clause by a passive infinitive:**the first man to be seen**.

​		2.When there is an **idea** of **purpose** or **permission**:

​				He has a lot of books **to read**.(books that he can/must read)

​				She had something **to do**.(something that she could do/had to do)

​				They need a garden **to play in**.(a garden they can play in)

​		Note that here the **infinitive** replaces **a verb + relative pronoun** as object.

​		It might be thought that **these two uses** of the **infinitive** would lead to confusion but in practice this is very rare as **the meaning of the infinitive** is made clear by the rest of the sentence.

​		By itself the phrase the **first man to see** could mean either **the first man** that **we must see**(man is the **object**) or **the first man who saw**(man is the **subject**),but when it is part of a sentence we can see at once which **meaning** is intended:

​		The first man **to see is Tom** = 

​		The first man **that we must see is Tom**, while

​		The first man **to see me was Tom** =

​		The first man **who saw me was Tom**.

##### B  Present participles can be used:

​	1.When the verb in the clause is in the **continuous tense**:

​			People who **are/were waiting for** the bus often shelter/sheltered in my doorway =

​			People **waiting for** the bus often shelter/sheltered...

​	2.When the verb in the **clause** expresses a **habitual** or **continuous action**:

​			Passengers **who travel/travelled** on this bus buy/bought their tickets in books =

​			Passengers **travelling**...

​			Boys who **attend/attended** this school have/had to wear uniform =

​			Boys **attending**...

​			a law **which forbids/forbade** the import =

​			a law **forbidding** the import

​			a notice **which warns/warned** people =

​			a notice **warning** people

​			an advertisement **which urges/urged** = 

​			an advertisement **urging**

​			Similarly:

​					a petition **asking**						a letter **ordering**/**demanding**/**telling**

​					a placard **protesting**                 placards **protesting**

​		3.When a **verb** in the **clause** expresses a **wish**,i.e. when the **verb** in the clause is **wish**,**desire**,**want**,**hope**(but not like):

​			people **who wish/wished** to go on the tour = 

​			people **wishing** to go on the tour

​			fans **who hope/hoped** for a glimpse of the star =

​			fans **hoping** for a glimpse of the star

​		4.A **non-defining clause** containing one of the above **verbs**,or any **verb** of **knowing** or **thinking**,e.g.  **know**,**think**,**believe**,**expect**,can be similarly replaced by a **present participle**:

​			Peter,**who thought** the journey would take two days,said... =

​			Peter,**thinking** the journey would take two days,said ...

​			Tom,**who expected** to be paid the following week,offered.. =

​			Tom,**expecting** to be paid the following week,offered...

​			Bill,**who wanted** to make an impression on Ann,took her to... =

​			Bill，**wanting** to make an impression on Ann,took her to...			

#### 9.Non-defining relative clauses

///// The following part is quoted from [Cambridge Ditionary Website]([https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95/%E8%8B%B1%E5%BC%8F%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95/relative-clauses-defining-and-non-defining](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/语法/英式语法/relative-clauses-defining-and-non-defining))

​	We use non-defining relative clauses to give **extra information** about the person or thing.It is **not necessary** information.We **don't need it** to understand **who** or **what** is being referred to.

​	We always use a relative pronoun(who,which,whose or whom) to introduce a non-defining relative clause(In the examples,the relative clause is in **bold**,and the person or thing being referred to is <u>underlined</u>.)

​	<u>Clare</u>,**who I work with**,is doing the London marathon this year.

​	Doctors use the testing kit for regular screening for <u>lung and stomach cancers</u>,**which account for 70% of cancers treated in the western world**.

​	<u>Alice</u>,**who has worked in Brussels and London ever since leaving Edinburgh**,will be starting a teaching course in the autumn.

​	Warning:

​	We don't use **that** to introduce a **non-defining relative clause**:

​	<u>Allen</u>,**who scored three goals in the first game**,was the only player to perform well.

##### Punctuation

​	In writing,we use commas around non-defining relative clauses:

​		Etheridge,**who is English-born with Irish parents**,replaces Neil Francis,**whose injury forced him to withdraw last week**.

​	Spoken English:

​		In speaking,we often pause at the beginning and end of the clause:

​			Unlike American firms-**which typically supply all three big American car makers**-Japanese ones traditionally work exclusively with one maker.(formal)

​			And this woman-**who I'd never met before**-came up and spoke to me.(informal)

#### 10.The **pronoun** can never be omitted in a non-defining relative clause.

#### 11.Non-defining relative clauses:persons

##### 	A.Subject:who

​			**No other pronoun** is possible.Note the commas:

​					My neighbour,**who is very pessimistic**,says there will be no apples this year.

​					Peter,**who had been driving all day**,suggested stopping at the next town.

##### 	B.Object:whom,who

​			The **pronoun** **cannot be omitted**.**whom** is the correct form,though **who** is sometimes used in conversation:

​			Peter,**whom everyone suspected**,turned out to be innocent.

​			But **non-defining clauses** coming later in the sentence,i.e. **after the object of the main verb** or after a **preposition + noun**,are common in conversation:

​			She wanted Tom,**whom she liked**,as a partner;but she got Jack,**whom she didn't like**.

​			She introduced me to her husband,**whom I hadn't met before**.

##### 	C.Object of a preposition: whom

​			The **pronoun** **cannot be omitted**. The **preposition** is normally placed before **whom**:

​			Mr Jones，for whom I was working,was very generous about overtime payments.

​			It is however possible to move the preposition to the end of the clause.This is commonly done in conversation,and **who** then usually takes the place of **whom**:

​			Mr Jones,who I was working for,...

#### 12.Connective relative clauses

​		The **pronouns** are **who**,**whom**,**whose**,**which**.Commas are used as with non-defining clauses.**Connective clauses** do not **describe** their **nouns** but **continue** the **story**.They are usually placed **after the object** of the main verb:

​			I told Peter,**who said it wasn't his business**.

​		or after the **preposition+noun**:

​			I threw the ball to Tom,**who threw it to Ann**.

​		They can be replaced by **and/but**+**he/she** etc...

​			I threw the ball to Tom **and he** threw it...

​			I told Peter,but he said...

​		Sometimes it may be **difficult** to say whether a **clause** in this **position** is **non-defining** or **connective**,but there is no need for students to make this distinction,as the two forms are the same.

​		More examples of connective clauses:

​				He drank beer,**which made him fat**. =

​				He drank beer **and** it made him fat.

​				We went with Peter, **whose car broke down before we were halfway there.**=

​				We went with Peter **but** his car broke down before we were halfway there.		We can use **one**/**two** etc.,**few**/**several**/**some** etc. + **of** +

​		**whom**/**which** as shown in 80:

​				I bought a dozen eggs,**six of which** broke when I dropped the box.

​				He introduced me to his boys,**one of whom** offered to go with me.

​				The lorry crashed into a queue of people,**several of whom** had to have hospital treatment.

​		**which** can also stand for **a whole clause**:

​				The clock struck thirteen,**which made everyone laugh**.

​				He refused to do his share of the chores,**which annoyed the others**.

​				(His refusal annoyed them.)

​		The rain rattled on the roof all night,**which kept us awake**.

​		She was much kinder to her youngest child than she was to the others,**which made the others jealous**.

#### 13. what(relative pronoun) and which(connective relative)

​	   what = **the thing that**/**the things that**:		

​				**What** we saw astonished us =

​				**The things that** we saw astonished us.				

​				When she sees **what** you have done she will be furious.=

​				When she sees **the damage that** you have done she will be furious.

​		Be careful not to confuse the relative **what** with the connective relative **which**.

​	    Remember that **which** must refer to **a word** or **group of words** in the **preceding sentence**,while **what** does not refer back to **anything**.

​		The relative **what** is also usually the **object of a verb**,while the **connective which** is usually the **subject**:

​		He said he had no money,**which** was not true.

​		Some of the roads were flooded,**which** made our journey more difficult.

#### 14. The importance of commas in relative clauses

​		Remember that a **defining relative clause** is written **without commas**.Note how the meaning changes when **commas** are **inserted**:

​		(a) The travellers **who knew about the floods** took another road.

​		(b) The travellers, **who knew about the floods**,took another road.

​		In (a) we have a **defining relative clause**,which **define** or **limits** the noun travellers.This sentence therefore tells us that **only the travellers who knew** about the floods took the other road,and **implies** that **there were other travellers who did not know** and who took the flooded road.In (b) we have a **non-defining clause**,which does not **define** or **limit the noun it follows**.This sentence therefore **implies** that **all the travellers knew about** the floods and took the other road.

​		(c) The boys **who wanted to play football** were disappointed when it rained.

​		(d) The boys**,who wanted to play football,**were disappointed when it rained.

​	Sentence (c) **implies** that **only some of the boys** wanted to play football.There were **presumably others who didn't mind** whether it rained or not.Sentence (d) **implies** that **all the boys wanted** to play and **all were disappointed**.

​		(e) The wine which was in the cellar was ruined.

​		(f) The wine**,which was in the cellar,**was ruined.

​		Sentence (e) implies that **only some** of the wine was **ruined**.

​		**Presumably some** was kept elsewhere and **escaped** damage.

​		Sentence (f) states that **all the wine was in the cellar** and ruined.

#### 15. whoever,whichever,whatever,whenever,wherever,however

​		These have **a variety of meanings** and can introduce **relative** and **other** **clauses**.

​	A **whoever**(pronoun) and **whichever**(pronoun and adjective) can mean **'the one who'**,**'he who'**,**'she who'**:

​		**Whoever** gains the most points wins the competition.

​		**Whichever of** them gains the most points wins.

​		**Whichever** team gains the most points wins.

​		**Whoever** gets home first starts cooking the supper.

​		**Whichever** of us gets home first starts cooking.

​		**Whoever** cleans your windows doesn't make a good job of it.

​	B **whatever** (pronoun and adjective),**whenever**,**whereever**:	

​		You can eat **what**/**whatever** you like.(**anything you like**)

​		When you are older you can watch **whatever** programme you like.

​		My roof leaks **when**/**whenever** it rains.(every time it rains)

​		You will see this product advertised **everywhere**/**wherever** you go.

​		Go **anywhere**/**wherever** you like.

​	C **whoever**,**whichever**,**whatever**,**whenever**,**wherever**,**however**  can mean 'no matter who' etc.

​		**whatever you do** is often placed **before** or after a **request/command** emphasize its **importance**:

​		**Whatever you do**,don't mention my name.

​		**however** is an **adverb** of degree and is used with an **adjective** or another **adverb**:

​		I'd rather have a room of my own,**however small (it is)**,than share a room.

​		**However hard I worked**,she was never satisfied.

​	D **whatever**,**wherever** can indicate the speaker's **ignorance** or **indifference**:

​				He lives in Wick,**wherever that is**.(I **don't know** where it is,and I'm **not very interested**.)

​				He says he's a phrenologist,**whatever that is**.(I **don't know** what it is and I'm **not very interested**.)

​		**who ever**? **when ever**?**what ever**?etc. may be written as separate words, but the meaning then changes:

​		I lost seven kilos in a month.  ~ How ever did you lose so much in such a short time?

​		BILL(suspiciously): I know all about you.

​		TOM(indignantly):What ever do you mean?

​		Where ever did you buy your wonderful carpets?
