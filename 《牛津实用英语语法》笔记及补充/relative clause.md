3.Defining relative clauses

​		We use *defining relative clauses* to give **essential** information about **someone** or **something** ——information that we need in order to **understand** what or who is being referred to.A *defining relative clause* usually **comes immediately after the noun** it describes.

​		We usually use a relative pronoun(e.g. who,that,which,whose and whom) to introduce a defining relative clause(In the examples,the **relative clause** is in **bold**,and the person or thing being referred to is <u>underlined</u>.):

​		They're <u>the people</u> **who want to buy our house**.

​		Here are <u>some cells</u> **which have been affected**.

​		They should give the money <u>to somebody</u> **who they think needs the treatment most**.

[talking about an actress]

​	She'w now playing <u>a woman</u> **whose son was killed in the First World War**.

Spoken English:

In **defining relative clauses** we often use *that* instead of *who*,*whom* or *which*.This is very common in informal speaking:

​	They're <u>the people</u> **that** want to buy our house.

​	Here are <u>some cells</u> **that** have been affected.

Subject or object

The **relative pronoun** can define the **subject** or the **object** of the **verb**:

​	They're <u>the people</u> **who/that bought our house**.（The people bought our house.*The people* is the subject.)

​	They're <u>the people</u> **who/that she met at Jon's party**.(She met the people.*The people* is the object.)

​	Here are <u>some cells</u> **which/that show abnormality**.(Some cells show abnormality.Some cells is subject.)

​	Here are <u>some cells</u> **which/that the researcher has identified**.(The researcher has identified some cells.*Some cells* is the object.)

No relative pronoun

We often **leave out the relative pronoun** when it is the **object** of the **verb**.

​	They're <u>the people</u> **she met at Jon's party**.

​	Here are <u>some cells</u> **the researcher has identified**.

4.Defining relative clauses usually *follow* **the+noun**,but they can also be used with **a/an+noun**,plural nouns without **the** and the pronouns **all**,**none**,**anybody**,**somebody** etc. and **those**.

Clauses following **a/an + noun**,plural nouns without **the** and **somebody**/**someone**/**something** sometimes define their noun/pronoun only indirectly.The noun/pronoun in these cases is usually the **object** of a verb or preposition:

​	I met someone **who** said he knew you.

​	The book is about a girl **who** falls in love with...

Sometimes these clauses are **separated** from their noun/pronoun **by a word or phrase**:

​	There's a man here **who** wants...

​	I saw something in the paper **which** would interest you.

But normally **relative clauses** should be placed **directly after** their noun or pronoun:

​	The noise **that** he made woke everybody up.

​	She was annoyed by something **that** I had said.
