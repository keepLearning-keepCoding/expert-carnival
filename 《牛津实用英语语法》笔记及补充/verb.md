1.definition of **infinitive**——（动词）原型，不定式(前面常加to): The infinitive of a verb is the **basic form**,for example 'do','be','take',and 'eat'.The **infinitive** is often used with **'to' in front of it**.

2.definition of **participle**——(语法中的)分词（包括过去分词和现在分词): In grammar, a participle is **a form of a verb** that can be used in **compound tenses of the verb**.There are two participles in English:**the past participle**,which usually **ends in '-ed'**,and **the present participle**,which **ends in '-ing'**.

3.definition of **continuous tense**——a **tense of verbs** used in describing **action** that is **on-going**.

4.An **active verb** or sentence is one in which the **subject** is the **person** or **thing** that **performs** the **stated action**:

- "Catrin told me" is an **active sentence**,and "I was told by Catrin" is **passive**.

##### 5.Classes of verbs:

​		A.There are two classes of verbs in English:

​			1.The **auxiliary verbs**(auxiliaries): **to be**,**to have**,**to do**;**can**, **could**, **may**, **might**, **must**, **ought**, **shall**, **should**, **will**, **would**, **to need**, **to dare** and **used**.

​			2.All other verbs,which we may call **ordinary verbs**:

​					to work     to sing      to pray

​		B. **be**, **have**, **do**, **need** and **dare** have **infinitives** and **participles** like ordinary verbs,but **can**, **could**, **may**, **might**, **must**, **ought**, **shall**, **should**, **will** and **would** have **neither infinitives** **nor participles** and therefore have only a restricted number of forms.

6.The **present participle** and **gerund** are always regular and are formed by **adding** **ing** to **infinitive**.The rule concerning the **doubling of the final consonant of the infinitive** before adding ing applies here also.

##### 7. Affirmative contractions

​	The auxiliaries be, have, will, would are contracted as follows:

​		am  'm          have   've		will	'll

​		is	 's			has	  's		 would  'd

​		are  're		  had    'd

​	Note that  **'s**  can be **is** or **has** and  **'d** can be **had** or **would**:

​		He's going = He **is** going.

​		He's gone = He **has** gone.

​		He'd paid = He **had** paid.

​		He'd like a drink = He **would** like a drink.

​	These **contractions** are used after **pronouns**, **here**,**there**,some question words,and short nouns:

​		Here's your pen.			The twins've arrived.

​		The car'd broken down.

​	**Affirmative contractions** are **not used** at the **end** of sentences:

​		You aren't in a hurry but I am.

​		(**I'm** would not be possible here.)

##### 8. Negatives of tenses

​	A. The simple present tense: **third person singular** *does not*/*doesn't* + *infinitive*; other persons do *not*/*don't* + *infinitive*.

​		The simple **past tense negative** for all persons is **did not**/**didn't** + **infinitive**

​		Contractions are usual in speech:

​				He **does not**/**doesn't** answer letters.

​				They **do not**/**don't** live here.

​				I **did not**/**didn't** phone her.

​				She **did not**/**didn't** wait for me.

​		The negative of all other tenses is formed by putting **not** **after** the **auxiliary**.

​		Contractions are usual in speech:

​				He **has not**/**hasn't** finished.

​				He **would not**/**wouldn't** come.				

​	B. Negative contractions

​			The auxiliaries **be**, **have**, **will**, **would**, **shall**, **should**, **do** are contracted as follows:	

​			am not    **'m not**

​			is not        **isn't** or **'s not**

​			are not 	**aren't** or **'re not**

​			I'm not going and Tom **isn't** going/Tom**'s not** going.

​			We  **aren't going**/We**'re not going**.

​			**have not** and **has not** contract to **haven't** and **hasn't**,but in perfect tenses **'ve not** and **'s not** are also possible:

​			We **haven't** seen him/We**'ve not** seen him.

​			He **hasn't**/He**'s not** come yet.

​			**will not** contracts to **won't**,though **'ll not** is also possible.**shall not** contracts to **shan't**:

​			I **won't go**/I**'ll not go** till I hear and I **shan't** hear till tomorrow.

​			Negative contractions can come at the end of a sentence:

​					I saw it but he **didn't**.

​			In English a **negative sentence** can have only one **negative expression** in it.**Two negative expressions** give the sentence an **affirmative** meaning:

​			**Nobody did nothing** means that everyone did something.

​			So **never**,**no** (adjective), **none**, **nobody**, **no one**, **nothing**, **hardly**, **hardly ever** etc. are used with an **affirmative verb**.We can say:

​			 He **didn't eat** anything or 

​			 He **ate** **nothing**.

​			 He **doesn't ever** complain or 

​			 He **never** complains.

​			 We **haven't seen** anyone or

​			 We **have seen no** one.

​			 They **didn't** speak much or

​			 They **hardly** spoke **at all**/They **hardly ever** spoke.

### Auxiliary verbs

##### 9.Auxiliaries and modal auxiliaries

| Principal   auxiliaries | Modal auxiliaries             | Semi-modals |
| :---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| to be                   | can                could      | to need     |
| to have                 | may                might      | to dare     |
| to do                   | must               had to     | used        |
|                         | ought                         |             |
|                         | shall                  should |             |
|                         | will                   would  |             |

Auxiliaries **help to form** a **tense** or an **expression**,hence the name.

They combine with **present** or **past participles** or with **infinitives** to form the **tenses of ordinary verbs**:
I  **am** coming.					He **has** finished.					I **didn't** see them.

They combine with infinitives to indicate permission,possibility,obligation,deduction etc. as will be shown in the following chapters.

​			He can speak French.				You may go.						We must hurry.

##### 10.Auxiliaries:forms and patterns

​	A. be, have and do (the principal auxiliaries)

| Infinitive | Present tense | Past tense | Past participle |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| to be      | am, is, are   | was        | been            |
| to have    | have,has      | had        | had             |
| to do      | do,does       | did        | done            |

1.In the **negative** and **interrogative**,**be** and **do** follow the **auxiliary pattern**:

​	Negative,verb + **not**:

​			He **isn't** coming.					It **did not** matter.

​	Interrogative,subject + verb:

​			Was **he waiting**?				Does **she see** us?

2. have normally follows the auxiliary pattern:

   ​	 **Has** he (got) to go?

   but sometimes uses **do/did** forms:

   ​	**Does** he have to go?

3. be takes the full infinitive:

      They **are** to wait for us at the station.

   **have** takes the full infinitive except in two constructions.

   do takes the bare infinitive: Did he write?

4. **be**, **have** and **do**,when used as auxiliaries,require a **participle** or **infinitive**,though in **answers**,**comments** etc. this is often **understood** but not **mentioned**:

   ​	Have you **seen** it? 	~ Yes,I have*(seen it)*.

5. **be**, **have** and **do** can also be used as **ordinary verbs** with **independent** meanings:i.,,e. **have** can mean 'possess',**do** can mean 'perform/occupy oneself' etc.

   **be** or **have** or **do** can then be the only verb in a sentence:

   ​			He **is** lazy.					He **has** no job.					He **does** nothing.

   **do** is then conjugated with **do/did**:

   ​		What **do** you **do** in the evenings?

   and **have** can be conjugated in either way:

   ​		**Have** you (got) time?/Do you **have** time?

B  can, could, may, might, must, ought, will, would, shall and should (the modal auxiliaries)

​		Modal verbs have **no final s** in the **third person singular**:

​				I must,he must				I can,he can

​	 They always form their **negative** and **interrogative** according to the **auxiliary pattern**:

​				will not 											ought not...

​				will he...?										  ought he...?

​	  They have no proper past tenses;four past forms exist, **could**,**might**,**should**,**would**, but they have only a restricted use.

​	  **Modal verbs** have **no infinitives** or **participles** and therefore **cannot be used in the continuous tenses**.

​	  All modal verbs except **ought** are followed by the **bare infinitive**:

​				You **should pay** but You **ought to pay**.

​	  A modal verb always requires an **infinitive**,though sometims this is **understood** but **not mentioned**:

​				Can you understand?		~ Yes,I can (understand).

C   **need**, **dare** and **used**(the semi-modals)

 1. When used as **auxiliaries**,**need** and **dare** can **conform to** the **modal pattern**.They then take the **bare infinitive**:

      	He **need** not wait.

    But they can also use the **do/did forms**,and then take the **full infinitive** with **to**:

    ​		He doesn't **dare to interrupt**.

    ​		They didn't **need to wait**.

    **need** and **dare** can also be used as **ordinary verbs**, and are then **inflected** and have the **usual participles**:

    ​		He **needs** help.							They **dared** me to jump.	

2.  **used**, sometimes referred to as **used to**, is used only in the past. For its **negative** and **interrogative** it usually **follows** the **auxiliary pattern**:

      	I **used not**/**usedn't** to go.

   But though technically **used** has no infinitive, the forms **didn't use to** and **did** he/she **use to**? are quite often heard.

#### Use of auxiliaries in short answers,agreements etc

**Auxiliaries** are extremely important in conversation because in **short answers**,**agreements** ,**disagreements with remarks**,**additions to remark** etc.  we use auxiliaries **instead of repeating the original verb**.

##### 11.Auxiliaries in short answers

​		Questions requiring the answer **yes** or **no**, i.e. questions such as *Do you smoke*? or *Can you ride a bicycle*? should be answered by **yes** or **no** and the auxiliary only.The **original subject**, if a **noun**, is **replaced by a pronoun**.Pronoun subjects may change as shown:

​		Do you smoke? ~ **Yes,I do**(not Yes,I smoke).

​		Is that Ann?     ~ **Yes,it is**/No it isn't.

​		Did the twins go?	~**Yes,they did**/No, they didn't.

​		Will there be an exam?  ~**Yes,there will**/No,there won't.		

​		If there is **more than one auxiliary** in the question,**the first should be used** in the answer:

​					Should he have gone?  ~ Yes,he should.

​		Questions with **must I**/**he** etc.  or **need I**/**he** etc. are answered **Yes,you/he** etc. **must** or **No,you/he** etc. **needn't**:

​		 **Must** I/**Need** I take all these pills?   ~ Yes,you **must**/No,you **needn't**.

​		An answer with **yes** or **no** without the auxiliary would be less polite.

##### 12.Finite and non-finite verbs

/// the following part is quoted from [Cambridge Dictionary]([https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95/%E8%8B%B1%E5%BC%8F%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95/finite-and-non-finite-verbs](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/语法/英式语法/finite-and-non-finite-verbs))

​	**Finite verb forms** show **tense**,**person** and **number**(I **go**,she **goes**,we **went**,etc.):

​		She **was waiting** in the room before he **came** in.

​		Does your brother **know** my brother?

​		The night before he **had** to leave,they **sat** on the small sofa in the living-room and **looked** at old family photos.

​		**Aren't** you a bit late?

​	**Non-finite** verb forms (非限定动词形式)do **not show tense**,**person** or **number**.Typically they are **infinitive forms** with and without **to**(e.g. **to go**,**to**),**-ing forms** and **-ed forms**(e.g. **going**,**gone**):

​	She tiptoed round the house so as not **to wake** anyone.

​	You need to paint the whole cupboard,**starting** from the bottom.

​	[from a biography]

​		Taken prisoner by the British in December 1776,he was held in New York City for a year...
