# The Quest

​		Taking the train, the two friends arrived in Berlin in late October 1922, and went **directly** to the address of Chou En-lai. Would this man receive them as fellow countrymen, or would he treat them with cold suspicion and question them cautiously about their past careers as militarists? Chu Teh remembered his age. He was thirty-six, his youth had passed like a screaming eagle, leaving him old and disillusioned.

​		When Chou En-lai's door opened they saw a slender man of more than average height with gleaming eyes and a face so striking that it bordered on the beautiful. Yet it was a manly face, serious and intelligent, and Chu judged him to be in his middle twenties.

​		Chou was a quiet and thoughtful man, even a little shy as he welcomed his visitors, urged them to be seated and to tell how he could help them.

​		Ignoring the chair offered him, Chu Teh stood squarely before this youth more than ten years his junior and in a level voice told him who he was, what he had done in the past, how he had fled from Yunnan, talked with Sun Yat-sen, been repulsed by Chen Tu-hsiu in Shanghai, and had come to Europe to find a new way of life for himself and a new revolutionary raod for China. He wanted to join the Chinese Communist Party group in Berlin, he would study and work hard, he would do anything he was asked to do **but** return to his old life, which had turned to ashes beneath his feet.

​		As he talked Chou En-lai stood facing him, his head a little to one side **as was his habit**, listening intently until the story was told, and then questioning him.

​		When both visitors had told their stories, Chou smiled a little, said he would **help** them find rooms, and **arrange for them to** join the Berlin Communist group as candidates until their application had been sent to China and **an answer received**. When the reply came a few months later they were enrolled as full members, but Chu's membership was kept a secret from outsiders.

## 探索

​		两个朋友乘坐火车于1922年10月底抵达柏林，直接到达周恩来的住址。这个男人将把他们当同胞来接待，还是将冷酷地怀疑他们，小心地质疑他们作为军事家的过往？朱德记得他的年龄，他那时36岁，青春已经像啸叫的鹰一样流逝，让他变得苍老而失望。

​		周恩来住所的门打开后，他们看到一个身材修长的人，两眼闪闪发光，面庞十分悦目，近乎俊美。但这是一张有男子气概的脸，严肃而睿智，朱德估计他二十五岁上下。

​		周恩来是个温和又考虑周到的男子，他招呼访客时甚至有些害羞，催促他们赶紧落座，并询问能否帮上什么忙。

​		朱德并未理会递给他的椅子，而是笔直地站在这个小他十岁的年轻人面前，用平静的语气告诉对方，他是谁，过去做些什么，他怎样逃离云南，与孙中山会谈，在上海被陈独秀驱逐以及来到欧洲寻找新生活，也为中国寻求新的革命道路。他想要加入中国共产党柏林小组，想要学习并努力工作，只要不让他回退到以前的生活(这使他绝望愤怒)，他就愿意做任何事情。

​		朱德讲话时，周恩来面对着他，头习惯性地稍稍偏向一侧，专注地听完对方的故事，然后开始提问。

​		两个来客都已叙述完毕后，周恩来微笑着说，将帮他们找到住处，在把他们的入党申请邮寄回中国并收到回复前，先安排他们以预备党员的身份加入柏林共产主义小组。

​		几个月后收到回复时，他们以正式党员的身份注册，但是朱德的党员身份对外界保密。

## 书上的译文：

​		他们两个人坐火车于一九二二年十月到达柏林，立即去周恩来的传住处。这个人会不会像同胞手足一样接待他们呢？会不会疑虑重重，详细询问他们在军阀时代的经历呢？朱德想起自己的年龄，他已三十六岁，青春像一路鸣叫的鹰，早已一闪而逝，留给他的是衰老和幻灭。

​	周恩来的房门打开时，他们看到的是一个身材瘦长、比普通人略高一点的人，两眼闪着光辉，面貌很引人注意，称得上清秀。可是，那是个男子汉的面庞，严肃而聪颖，朱德看他大概是二十五六岁的年龄。

​	周恩来举止优雅，待人体贴，在招呼他们坐下，询问有何见教的时候，甚至还有些腼腆。

​	朱德顾不得拉过来的椅子，端端正正地站在这个比他年轻十岁的青年面前，用平稳的语调，说明自己的身份的经历：他怎样逃出云南，怎样在上海被陈独秀拒绝，怎样为了寻求自己的新的生活方式和中国的新的革命道路而来到欧洲。他要求加入中国共产党在柏林的党组织，他一定会努力学习的工作，只要不再回到旧的生活里去——它已经在他的脚下化为尘埃了——派他做什么工作都行。

​	 他娓娓而谈，周恩来就站在他面前，习惯地侧着头，一直听到朱德把话说完，才提出问题。

​	两位来客把经历说完后，周恩来微笑着说，他可以帮他们找到住的地方，替他们办理加入党在柏林的支部的手续，在入党申请书寄往中国而尚未批准之前，暂作候补党员。过了几个月，回信来了，两人都被吸收为正式党员，但朱德的党籍对外界保持秘密。
