# In the sense that

The following interpretation is quoted from [StackExchange](#https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/162159/meanings-of-in-the-sense-that)

"In the sense that" is correctly used to **distinguish** between **two possible senses** (approximately **meanings**) of a word or phrase. So:

- "This fact is funny, in the sense that it makes me laugh."

  or

- "This fact is funny, in the sense that it is strange."
