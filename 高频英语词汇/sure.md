8.PHRASE 果真；果然（尤用在讲故事时）

​	You say **sure enough**, especially when telling a story, to confirm that **something was really true** or **was actually happening**.

- We found the English treacle pudding too good to resist. **Sure enough**, it was delicious...

  我们觉得英国糖蜜布丁太好吃了，令人无法抗拒。**的确**非常美味。

- I was in a shop when I saw a lady looking carefully at me. She'd recognised me, and **sure enough**, she came across.

  我正在逛商店，突然看到一位女士在仔细地打量我。她认出了我，**果不其然**，她走了过来。
