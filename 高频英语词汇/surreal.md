1. ##### ADJ-GRADED 离奇的；怪诞的；梦幻的；超现实的

   If you describe something as **surreal**, you mean that the **elements** in it are combined **in a strange way** that you would **not normally expect**, **like in a dream**.

- 'Performance' is undoubtedly one of the most **surreal** movies ever made.

  《迷幻演出》无疑是有史以来最**离奇**的电影之一。
